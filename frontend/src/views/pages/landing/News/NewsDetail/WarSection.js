                Sounds like a reboot, doesn't it? God of War continues the story Kratos, but changes ancient Greece to no less ancient
                Scandinavia and its myths. It's time to kill some Norse gods.

                However, the changes don't stop there. The developers are completely rethought the series and rebuilt the gameplay,
                introducing many new elements for the franchise. One of them is Kratos' son, Atreus, who helps you during the quest with his
                abilities. Blades with double chain? Forget about them, a mighty battle ax with magical powers is where He!
